        <h3>Higurashi series history</h3>
        <article><img class="left" src="../media/HigurashiVN_Orig.jpg">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (which roughly translates to "When the Cicadas Cry") is a series of eight kinetic visual/sound novels by 07th Expansion, released between 2002 and 2006 and later adapted into both an anime and a manga series. It is the first series in the When They Cry franchise, followed by Umineko no Naku Koro ni and Ciconia no Naku Koro ni.<hr>While these eight games make up the main series, several bonus chapters are available, including "Rei" (a fandisc collection of three sidestories that take place after the main plot) and a fourth, anime-only installment, "Kira" (a series of light hearted fanservice OVAs that are outside of continuity). There are also several short, manga-only arcs, usually placed before or after the main story and introducing new characters, while retaining the typical atmosphere of the series. These arcs were adapted with some new ones for the Nintendo DS under the title Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna (2008).<hr>The sound novels also had an updated re-release for PlayStation 2 named Matsuri (2007), with the original final arc (Matsuribayashi-hen) left out and replaced by an alternate ending (Miotsukushi-hen), as well as two additional arcs. The ports turn the games into bona-fide Visual Novels with choices and routes rather than independent successive arcs like the original version. Later ports to other consoles added even more extra material.<img class="right" src="../media/HigurashiVN_PS3.webp"><hr>An anime adaptation by Studio DEEN aired in 2006, with a continuation, entitled Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, airing in 2007 and covering the last two arcs. A sequel anime by Studio Passione titled Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou premiered in October 2020, and a second sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu premiered in July 2021; they partly serve as a thematic link between Higurashi and the second "When They Cry" series, Umineko.<img class="left" src="../media/HigurashiAnime2006.jpg"><hr>Two Live-Action Adaptations were made, titled Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (2008) and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Chikai (2009), which adapt the first and sixth novel, respectively. An OVA called Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak, based on Ryukishi07's short story, was released in 2013.<hr>A sequel series, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, was introduced shortly after the end of Gou/Sotsu. Taking place in the Reiwa era some thirty years after the events of the original series, the story now focuses on the children of our protagonists as Keiichi's son Keitarou returns to Hinamizawa after five years.<hr>While the eight core games were translated by MangaGamer in 2009, the translation was largely considered rather poor. However, starting in 2015, the entire series (including the eight main games, the three Rei games, and the three Hou games) will be given a Western release, with updated sprites and a re-translation, from the same company under the title Higurashi When They Cry Hou. The eight main games have been released and can be purchased from Steam or GOG.com.<img class="right" src="../media/HigurashiAnime2020.jpg"><hr>In September 2020, a smartphone game with gacha elements and featuring a "sequel" story to the original visual novel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Mei was released to tie-in with the premiere of Gou.

        <h3>Higurashi plot summary</h3>
        <article>Higurashi no Naku Koro ni takes place during June 1983, at a fictional rural village called Hinamizawa, which has a population of approximately 2000. The main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hojo. Keiichi joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and board games (and punishment games for the loser, usually him.) Hinamizawa appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi. However, the tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, Oyashiro-sama. Keiichi learns that every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered and another has gone missing on the day of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival and Oyashiro-sama. In each story arc, he or one of his friends become paranoid, and a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their own friends. While it seems impossible to tell their delusions apart from the mystery of Hinamizawa, slowly the truth is revealed.
