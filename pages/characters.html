            <h3>Keiichi Maebara</h3>
            <p>The main protagonist in the "question" arcs. The son of a famous artist, his family recently moved to Hinamizawa after an unfortunate event involving him in their hometown. His charisma and remarkable talent for speechmaking allow him to easily make new friends and become popular in the village. The first arc, Onikakushi-hen, is focused on him.

            <h3>Rena Ryugu</h3>
            <p>A girl who returned from Ibaraki to Hinamizawa one year ago, and she is in the same grade level as Keiichi. She has an obsession with things she perceives as cute, whether they're actually adorable or butt-ugly. Every now and then, she goes treasure hunting in the town's trash heap, searching for "cute" things to collect, and upon finding something "cute", it's difficult to stop her from taking it home. Despite this disarming trait, Rena is shown to be amazingly observant and perceptive about the things around her. According to Mion, while Rena might seem cute herself, people should be careful not to anger her, as she becomes quite scary. She is especially sensitive about the topic of Oyashiro-sama, who she fears will curse her for leaving Hinamizawa. The sixth arc, Tsumihoroboshi-hen, is focused on her.

            <h3>Mion Sonozaki</h3>
            <p>The oldest classmate in Keiichi's class. Her social skills are on par with Keiichi, whom she highly respects as a friend and rival (though it is later shown that she has a crush on him). She acts boyish, but has a hidden girlish side. She is next in line to be the head of the Sonozaki household, one of the Three Families which holds tremendous influence in Hinamizawa. Her position as heir is marked by an oni tattoo on her back. The second arc, Watanagashi-hen, is focused on her.

            <h3>Shion Sonozaki</h3>
            <p>Mion's identical twin sister, who currently resides in Okinomiya. Unlike her twin, she is girly and somewhat cold. In spite of their different personalities, she and Mion often switch places, and it can be difficult to distinguish between them. She was sent by the Sonozaki family to a private boarding school, but escaped and returned to live near her hometown, where she lives with Kasai. She was in love with Satoshi, and blames the Three Families of Hinamizawa for his disappearance. She works as a waitress at the Angel Mort restaurant and is the manager's assistant for the Hinamizawa Fighters little league team. The fifth arc, Meakashi-hen, is focused on her.

            <h3>Satoko Houjou</h3>
            <p>A younger classmate in Keiichi's school. In spite of her young age, she seems to have an impressive arm strength and is quite clever in setting up traps, which she likes to practice on Keiichi. Although her personality is quite energetic and mischievous during the events of the games, Satoko's past was full of trauma; her family were outcasts for supporting the dam project that would have destroyed the village, her parents died in an accident, she was abused by her foster parents (her aunt and uncle), and her beloved brother Satoshi disappeared. She greatly misses Satoshi, and feels that by being strong, he will return. She cannot tell the difference between cauliflower and broccoli because she is color blind. The third arc, Tatarigoroshi-hen, is focused on her.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Rika Furude</h3>
            <p>A younger classmate in Keiichi's school, who is in the same grade level as Satoko. Naturally, she is great friends with her, as they live together in the same house. She is the Miko of the Shrine of Oyashiro-sama, and some of the villagers revere her as a prophet. She has been the head of the Furude family since her parents died, but rarely attends town meetings due to her young age. The seventh arc, Minagoroshi-hen, is focused on her.

            <h3>Jirou Tomitake</h3>
            <p>A freelance photographer who comes to Hinamizawa occasionally. He gets along well with Miyo Takano because of their similar interests in photography. Despite being only an occasional visitor, he seems to know a fair amount about Hinamizawa's past. Ooishi and the police are suspicious of his identity.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Miyo Takano</h3>
            <p>A nurse at the village clinic who has a keen interest in Hinamizawa's past and culture, recording all her speculation in notebooks. At times, her storytelling can be very mysterious and chilling, and she seems to enjoy putting people on edge. Unlike the other villagers, she opposes the almighty Oyashiro-sama.

            <h3>Rumiko Chie</h3>
            <p>The female teacher of Keiichi's class, who is a parody character of Tsukihime's Ciel-senpai. Going along with the parody, her favorite food is curry rice, just like Ciel.

            <h3>Kyousuke Irie</h3>
            <p>The head doctor of the village clinic. Initially interested in being a doctor just for the money, he became devoted to the field of psychosurgery after a head injury changed his father's personality. Despite his young age and the fact that he has a severe maid fetish, he is highly respected in the community. He cheerfully makes house calls and seems to truly care about everyone's health. He has (half-jokingly) admitted that he wishes to marry Satoko when she is older, but is not above chasing after Rika when she is wearing one of the uniforms from the restaurant Angel Mort. In addition, he is the manager of the village's baseball little league team, the Hinamizawa Fighters.

            <h3>Kuraudo Ooishi</h3>
            <p>A veteran police investigator at Okinomiya who has vowed to solve the mystery of the Hinamizawa murders before his retirement, due to personal reasons. Due to his uncouth tactics and the lengths that he goes to in order to solve the mystery, he is looked upon as a nuisance by the villagers. He approaches one of the main characters to become his informant in several arcs, and is sometimes unwittingly responsible for triggering their paranoia.

        <div>
            <h3>Mamoru Akasaka</h3>
            <p>A young police investigator at the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo. He befriended Rika while investigating a case in Hinamizawa four years ago, all due to a prophecy about his wife which came true; he, however, just brushed it off as coincidence. The fourth arc, Himatsubushi-hen (Time-wasting), is dedicated to him.

        <div>
            <h3>Hanyu</h3>
            <p>The mysterious "transfer student" in Matsuribayashi-hen. She has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen does she choose to interact with others. She is very meek and often makes the noise "Au au au" when she is nervous or uncomfortable. The eighth arc, Matsuribayashi-hen, is focused on her.
