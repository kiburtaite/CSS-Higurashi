                    <h4>Onikakushi-hen</h4>
                    <p>The chapter introduces the player to the world of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The player is shown the simple rural life of the village, the after-school club activities, and the friendships of the main characters. However, things take a sinister turn after the Watanagashi Festival, when Keiichi discovers what his new friends have been concealing from him and breaks off from them. Mion and Rena are portrayed as the villains in this chapter; at the end of it, Keiichi kills them, believing they were about to murder him, before later tearing out his own throat.</p>

                    <h4>Watanagashi-hen</h4>
                    <p>The player should have an overall idea of how life in the village resembles. This episode heavily focuses on the twin Sonozaki sisters, Mion and Shion (the latter debuting). During this chapter, the history of Hinamizawa and the Watanagashi Festival is expanded upon. This chapter's bad events are once again marked by the Watanagashi Festival; shortly after it, several members of the village go missing. Mion is once again portrayed as the villain in this chapter.</p>

                    <h4>Tataragoroshi-hen</h4>
                    <p>This episode stars Satoko, who develops a very close brother-sister relationship with Keiichi. Unfortunately, Satoko's abusive uncle returns to the village, and efforts to get his custody removed fail. After Satoko suffers a breakdown from his abuse, Keiichi snaps and murders the uncle, hoping for a return to normalcy, but the exact opposite occurs when more people die before all of Hinamizawa is wiped out in a gas disaster.</p>

                    <h4>Himatsubushi-hen</h4>
                    <p>This episode takes place five years before the first three chapters. Tokyo police investigator, Mamoru Akasaka, investigates a kidnapping of a politician's grandchild around the village. The chapter focuses on Rika Furude as being the key part of the mystery, as she is mysteriously able to predict the incidents that happened in the subsequent years. Kuraudo Ooishi, otherwise a supporting character, plays a major role as Akasaka's trusted ally and senior in this chapter.</p>

                    <h4>Meakashi-hen</h4>
                    <p>Meakashi-hen is the answer arc corresponding to Watanagashi-hen. The chapter consists of events very similar to those of Watanagashi-hen told from the perspective of Shion. In this chapter, it is revealed that Shion and Mion had been pretending to be each other in the second half of Watanagashi-hen, and that Shion was actually the killer then.</p>

                    <h4>Tsumihoroboshi-hen</h4>
                    <p>Tsumihoroboshi-hen is the answer arc corresponding to Onikakushi-hen. Unlike Meakashi-hen, Tsumihoroboshi-hen's story is drastically different from the plot of its question arc. Keiichi suddenly remembers the events of Onikakushi-hen, and realizes that he had been delusional and mistaken in his suspecting of Rena and Mion. With this knowledge, he is able to help Rena, who falls into the same trap that he did and succumbs to paranoia and distrust as well. This is the first chapter with a (seemingly) happy ending since Keiichi stops Rena from murdering any of her friends, although the epilogue reveals that the gas disaster still occurred.</p>

                    <h4>Minagoroshi-hen</h4>
                    <p>On the surface, Minagoroshi-hen is the solution to Tatarigoroshi-hen; however, it answers most of the major common mysteries of the previous arcs. It is told from the perspective of Rika Furude and reveals her ability to travel between worlds. Minagoroshi-hen primarily shows Keiichi working tirelessly to end the abuse Satoko faces at the hands of her uncle, without resorting to murder; after rallying the town behind him, he is successful. Minagoroshi-hen finally reveals that the true antagonist is Miyo Takano; however, occupied by Satoko's predicament, the group is not able to defeat her in the end, so one more effort is needed to seal the story into a happy ending.</p>

                    <h4>Matsuribayashi-hen</h4>
                    <p>With all pieces of the puzzle in place, it's up to the characters to join forces in order to defeat Miyo and stop her from destroying the village. Matsuribayashi-hen is a "Good End" in which the tragic events that occurred during June 1983 in the previous arcs are averted. It also features many "Fragments" that detail the events in the previous years to resolve any mysteries not yet answered.</p>
